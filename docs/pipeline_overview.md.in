# Conversion Pipelines

{{content}}

Currently supported are only these pipelines:

- PDF to HTML for all STMicro documents.
- HTML to SVD for STMicro STM32 Reference Manuals only.
- Header to SVD for STMicro STM32 CMSIS Header files.

In particular, the conversion to OWL is prototyped, but not really useful yet.
